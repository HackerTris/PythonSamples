This repo contains a bunch of simple Python code samples.  I created
it to practice interviewing questions, as well as to create some simple
patterns that I can use for reference later.

Most of the samples are taken from "Cracking the Coding Interview", by Gayle McDowell.  However, I created the coding samples in Python.  

Each sample unit also contains its own unit tests.  

As I mentioned above, these coding samples were useful for helping me to work out sample algorithms.  In addition, some of these samples will create useful patterns or references for later work.
